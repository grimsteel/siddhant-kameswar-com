This license **does not** apply to the `src/_data/projects` directory and all files under it.

## Structure

This website is built using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), a really nice static site generator. The data for all of the projects is stored as yaml in the `src/_data` folder, and pretty much everything on the side is generated from these files. 

The backend for the contact form is hosted on Cloudflare Workers.

There's as little JavaScript as possible on the site, giving it a perfect PageSpeed Insights score:
