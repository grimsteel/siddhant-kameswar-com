    A big issue with infrared devices is that if the remote stops
    working, the entire device essentially becomes useless.
    Using my Arduino and an IR receiver, I decoded the IR codes for 
    the overhead lights in my office and set up a replacement for the remote.

    I was concerned about the privacy issues surrounding using the official app

    low energy protocol the watch used, using my phone's BLE log and Wireshark.
    I created this web application as an open source and secure alternative to
    the app.

    (and their friends) started to use it. As this was bigger than any project
    I had done before, I decided to track the code with Git. I learnt how to use
    Firebase for storing data, authentication, and hosting.
