    This application displayed the status of several low water crossings in my area.
    The website (https://atxfloods.com) was very slow, so I made this app as a faster
    and more convenient way of getting exactly the information the user cared about.

    After making the initial version of Flood Status, I quickly realized that non native solutions
    like Xamarin were very slow. I rewrote the app using Kotlin and the native Android SDK.

    I created this app as an extension to my Trip Planning platform in order to allow us to quickly view data from Trip Planning
    and launch Google Maps with directions to various destinations. I created an Android Auto interface to allow opening directions
    from within the car itself. During this process, I ended up creating a Google Play Store account due to requirements in Android AUto.

    My family and I needed a way to quickly communicate our geographic locations to each other,
    even in areas with limited connectivity (cell service). This app provided a way to send the
    user's current location in a text message in a few taps, and view a location received in a
    text message in Google Maps.

    The "recent" shortcuts in Google Maps are unreliable, especially on Android Auto.
    I made this app to provide a reliable way to quickly open directions to various saved
    locations.
