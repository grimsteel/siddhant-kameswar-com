    I was concerned about the privacy issues surrounding using the official app
    for my smartwatch, the Mi Smart Band 4. (The "S" in IOT stands for "secure") I reverse engineered the Bluetooth
    low energy protocol the watch used, using my phone's BLE log and Wireshark.
    I created this web application as an open source and secure alternative to
    the app.

    Chromebooks, which I used at school, didn't have a text editor built in. I created this web application
    as a replacement, which allowed me to edit files on my Chromebook's filesystem - think Notepad with syntax highlighting.

    I created Vocabustudy as a fast, free, and ad-free alternative to Quizlet, an
    educational studying platform. It quickly took off as many of my friends
    (and their friends) started to use it. As this was bigger than any project
    I had done before, I decided to track the code with Git. I learnt how to use
    Firebase for storing data, authentication, and hosting.
