    A big issue with infrared devices is that if the remote stops
    working, the entire device essentially becomes useless.
    Using my Arduino and an IR receiver, I decoded the IR codes for 
    the overhead lights in my office and set up a replacement for the remote.

  description: "I decided to remake my Arduino IR Light controller with an ESP32. This time, I didn't use an IR library and wrote the code to encode and decode the NEC protocol manually. I configured the ESP32 to connect via WiFi to an MQTT server to make Home Assistant integration easier."

  description: I set up the Roborock Home Assistant integration to allow management of the robot vacuum directly through Home Assistant, rather than through Xiaomi's proprietary app. Even though the vacuum, being on a different VLAN, did not accept requests from Home Assistant's VLAN, I was able to accomplish this by setting up a NAT forwarding rule in pfsense.
